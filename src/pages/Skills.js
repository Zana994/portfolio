      <h3>My RoadMap to becoming a Front-End Developer and Tech Skills:</h3>
      <div className='skills'>
        <div className='paragraph'>
        <span>-- HTML --&gt;</span> 
        <p>
          Of course I started with the foundation of every website. After I thoroughly researched and learned about its possibilities
          and useage of elements, attributes etc., it was time to add some styles and make it look good.
        </p>
        </div>
        
        <div className='paragraph'>
        <span>-- CSS --&gt;</span>
        <p>  
          I spent quite time on learning and mastering CSS. I wanted to learn how to do it 
          all by myself, without preprocessors and frameworks, so I could understand how everything acctualy works.
          I've loved to challenge myself with more advanced layouts, so in the beginning at some point you got stuck
          with all the positioning and overlapping and you think that you will never get out of it..
          but once you learn how to do it, more easier it becomes. It's entertaining how much animations and cool stuff you 
          can do with CSS only. Once you become pixel perfect, everywhere you look u catch imperfections.
        </p>
        </div>
        
        <div className='paragraph'>
        <span>-- SCSS --&gt;</span>
        <p>
          Now it was a time to make my coding easier and faster and add more possibilities with
          preprocessor and I've used it ever since.
        </p>
        </div>
        
        <div className='paragraph'>
        <span>-- BOOTSTRAP --&gt;</span>
        <p>
          Although all of these designs I can do by myself and to be honest a lot of it I still do,
          I realized life is too short and time is too precious to not to use it.
        </p>
        </div>
       
       <div className='paragraph'>
       <span>-- JavaScript --&gt;</span>
       <p>
          Since I've already had experience with programming languages, learning JS was not a big 
          challenge for me but It was quite fun making these interactions and manipulations for creating dynamic websites. Beside
          that, I wanted to work and create things with pure Vannila JS before jumping to any frameworks.
        </p>
       </div>
        
        <div className='paragraph'>
        <span>-- REACT JS --&gt;</span>
        <p>
          For a first JavaScript framework to learn I chose React and I am still in the process of 
          mastering it.
        </p>
        </div>

        <div className='paragraph'>
        <span>-- REACT NATIVE --&gt;</span>
        <p>
          Along with React, for mobile app development I chose to work with React Native.
        </p>

        <div className='paragraph'>
        <span>-- TESTING --&gt;</span>
